The csearch program is the simple C program that was used to select a
mapping of instructions to 6-bit codons for maximum evolvability.  It
uses a simple 'hill-climbing' search algorithm to find the codon mapping
with the least statistical probability of a mutation being catastrophic.

The file csearch.out.bz2 contains the results of the run of csearch that
resulted in the codon mapping used in the Archis project.  (Look at the
last output block in the file.)
